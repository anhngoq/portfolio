    <h1>Thoughts...?</h1>
    <p>I'm actually not sure what to put into this section. I'm usually an overthinker, but nothing comes to mind right
        now. I guess I'll start with basic things.

        <h2>Life</h2>
        <p>A lot of people know what they want to do with their life. At least that's what they show on social media. I
            don't. I'm not sure what I <em>really</em> want to do. I'm not after niche causes or great fortune, I just
            want to live a fulfilled life beside my loved ones.</p>
