            <h3>Violin</h3>
            <p>I used to play the violin everyday. I even got some certifications from London College of Music (LCM).
                Thinking back, it would've been more of a flex had I chose ABRSM. Nowadays, I don't have that much time
                anymore (thanks to Rose lol), but I still enjoy listening to music every now and then.</p>

            <h3>Recommendations</h3>
            <p>While I'm open to trying new things, I'm very loyal when it comes to music. I can barely remember the
                last time I add something new to my playlist.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sweet - Cigarettes After Sex</li>
                <li>Glimpse of Us - Joji</li>
                <li>Space Song - Beach House</li>

        <h2>Sport?</h2>
        <p>I'm not an avid sport fan (mostly because I can't remember all the rules associated with it), but I really
            like playing ping pong. I started playing since middle school but didn't learn much
            from the coaches. Most of my experience came from late night battles with my friends at Rose :)</p>
